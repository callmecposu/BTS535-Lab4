# Definition of Done (DoD) for Mobile App: Hosting/Joining Local Events

## 1. Introduction

The Definition of Done (DoD) ensures that each feature and functionality meets the agreed-upon quality standards before it is considered complete. This document provides a checklist for the team to verify that a task is "done" by ensuring it fulfills both functional and non-functional requirements. Adherence to the DoD guarantees that features are ready for release and integration into the main application.

## 2. Completion Criteria
The following sections define the criteria that each task or feature must satisfy:

### 2.1. Functional Criteria
- User Stories are fully implemented as described.
- Features desribed in user stories are operational.
- Acceptance criteria for each task are verified by the team member who defined the problem.
### 2.2. Non-Functional Criteria
- The app responds efficiently (low latency) to user interactions.
- Performance benchmarks are achieved for both mobile and backend components.
- Security standards are implemented, avoiding possible breaches.
## 3. Code Quality
- Code is peer-reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
- Automated tests (unit and integration) are written, cover key functionality, and pass.
- No critical bugs are found in key features.
## 4. Testing
- Manual testing of user stories is complete. Testers confirm that implementation empowers user interactions defined in the user stories.
- End-to-End tests are written for all major user flows
- Cross-platform compatibility is verified (Android and iOS) to ensure uniform behavior.
- UI testing is complete and all interfaces work well across device sizes.
- Real-time communication tests are done for WebSockets to ensure smooth chat functionality.
## 5. Documentation
- Technical documentation (for features like React Native integration, Node.js backend, MongoDB, WebSockets) is complete and up to date.
- API documentation is written, particularly for external components like Stripe, Google Maps API, and TensorFlow.
- User documentation for organizers and attendees, detailing how to utilize new features, is written.
## 6. Deployment
- The feature is deployed to staging and tested thoroughly in this environment.
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are green, with successful automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- The app passes staging tests and is deployed to production with zero significant errors.
## 7. Approvals and Sign-Offs
- The team member who proposed the user story has signed off on the feature after testing.
- The Product Owner or designated lead approves the feature before deployment to production.
## 8. Tools and Systems
- Version control (Git) reflects clear commit messages, and branches are merged cleanly without conflicts.
- Code review tools (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests) are used for peer reviews.
- Monitoring tools (e.g., Google Analytics) are configured for real-time app performance tracking.
## 9. Version Control
- All changes are committed and tagged with appropriate version numbers.
- Changelog is updated to document new features, fixes, and changes.
## 10. Review and Updates
- The DoD is reviewed at the end of each sprint to ensure it remains relevant and updated as new technologies and requirements are introduced.
